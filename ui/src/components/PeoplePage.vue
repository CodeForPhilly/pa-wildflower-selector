      Many of us came together in April 2021, to join Zachary Leahan in this
      Code for Philly Project. Some of us joined on a little later on, but
      whether here for a short time or a long time or somewhere in between, we
      were all on fire to get this built in order to help gardeners from
      novice to expert find native plants to put into their gardens. For many
      of us, it is an app we had always wanted, for others, it was a chance to
      learn a lot about native plants. The projectâ€™s original name was the
      PA-Wildflower Selector. This initial idea that began with Zachary
      creating a Tableau project to utilize a database he had found, morphed
      over many months into the responsive web application you find here
      today.

      <p>
        The team consisted of 3 UX Designers fresh from bootcamp/flex programs,
        a seasoned developer, a new developer, a technical CPA, and a data
        engineer. So many varied backgrounds and side interests in this bunch.
        What a great team to work with.
